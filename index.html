		<h1>why <mark>donate</mark>?</h1>

		<p>Every child has the right to an education, regardless of their background, ethnicity, or socioeconomic status. Unfortunately, many children around the world are denied this right due to various factors such as poverty, discrimination, or lack of resources. By supporting a charity organization that provides children with equal opportunities for education, you are helping to ensure that this fundamental human right is upheld.
</p>

		<p>Access to education is crucial for children to reach their full potential and build better futures for themselves and their communities. By supporting a charity organization that provides children equal opportunity to education, you can help empower children with the skills and knowledge they need to succeed in life and contribute positively to society.
		</p>

		<p>Education is one of the most powerful tools we have to help individuals and communities thrive. By donating, you can help equip them with the knowledge and skills they need to succeed in life, whether it's pursuing higher education, starting a business, or contributing to their communities in meaningful ways.
